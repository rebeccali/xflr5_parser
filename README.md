This script is used to parse XFLR5 files into CSV files. Run it using:

`python3 xflr5_polar_parser -i myfolder -o myfile.csv`

`myfolder` should be a folder full of polars with different flap deflections.
The foil should be named "somefoil blah balh d10" where 10 would be the flap deflection amount.
